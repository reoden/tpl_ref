# ecnerwala's CP Book

This is my library of reference code for competitive programming. The goal is to
write generic, fast, and clean algorithm implementations for use in contests
like CodeForces or ICPC.

## Building

Build using

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

Test with

```sh
ctest --test-dir build
```

## License and Attribution
